## Printing to a dot\-matrix line printer\.


</div>

### Description

I've been asked several times how to print 1 line at-a-time to a dot-matrix line printer. The existing VB print daemon does the buffer thing and only supports page printing to an inkjet/laser printer. Here is the link I found at Microsoft that explains how to print 1 line at a time.

Go to the website and cut/paste the code.
